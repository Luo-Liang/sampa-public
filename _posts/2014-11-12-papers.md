Congratulations to Brandon Lucia whose last chapter of his thesis was accepted to CGO on data provenance in multithreaded programs; to Thierry, Mark Wyse, Adrian and Jacob on their HPCA paper on their FPGA-based neural networks paper; and to Mike Ringenburg and Adrian on their ASPLOS paper on debugging and monitoring quality in approximate programs! Great news!!
