## Workshop Program

### Saturday, June 13, 2015; OCC C120--C121

**9:00--9:30am:** Opening and introductions

Be ready to say who you are, where you're affiliated with, and why you're at the workshop.

**9:30--10:30am:** Position paper talks, session 1: *Quality*

Each talk will be 10 minutes, and each will have 3 minutes for short clarification questions immediately afterward.

The last 20 minutes of the session will be for discussion of all three papers: first, we'll spend 10 minutes in small-group discussion; the last 10 minutes will be for discussion among the whole group and asking questions of the speakers.

  * Towards Automated Differential Program Verification for Approximate
    Computing.  
    Shuvendu K. Lahiri (Microsoft Research) and Zvonimir Rakamaric (University
    of Utah)
  * ACOCO: Adaptive Coding for Approximate Computing on Faulty Memories.  
    Chu-Hsiang Huang, Yao Li, and Lara Dolecek (UCLA)
  * REACT: A Framework for Rapid Exploration of Approximate Computing
    Techniques.  
    Mark Wyse, Andre Baixo, Thierry Moreau, Bill Zorn, James Bornholt, Adrian
    Sampson, Luis Ceze, and Mark Oskin (University of Washington)

**10:30--11:00am:** Break

**11:00--11:30am:** Lightning talks

Each speaker gets 60 seconds and 60 seconds for questions while the next speaker gets in position. Any time left over at the end will be for large-group discussion and more questions for the speakers.

  * Mithra: Controlling Quality Tradeoffs in Approximate Acceleration  
    Divya Mahajan, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Jongse Park, Bradley Thwaites, Hadi
    Esmaeilzadeh
  * Axilog: Language Support for Approximate Hardware Design  
    Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Divya Mahajan, Bradley Thwaites, Jongse Park, Anandhavel
    Nagendrakumar, Sindhuja Sethuraman, Kartik Ramkrishnan, Nishanthi
    Ravindran, Rudra Jariwala, Abbas Rahimi, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh, Kia Bazargan
  * ...

**11:30am--noon:** Organizing for lunchtime discussions

We'll select topics for discussion over lunch, assign groups to topics, and choose a scribe for each group. The scribe will be responsible for reporting out from the discussion after lunch.

**noon--1:30pm:** Lunch

If you're a group's scribe, be sure to use the last few minutes of the lunch slot to prepare for reporting out---make your slides if you want to use any.

**1:30--2:00pm:** Summary discussion from lunch breakouts

Each group's scribe has a few minutes to talk and lead discussion on the results from the topic.

**2:00--3:00pm:** Position paper talks, session 2: *Domains*

10+3 minutes per talk; 10 minutes small-group discussion; 10 minutes large-group discussion.

  * Statistical Information Processing: Extending the Limits of Approximate
    Computing.  
    Sharad Malik and Naveen Verma (Princeton University), Subhasish Mitra
    (Stanford University), and Naresh Shanbhag (University of Illinois, Urbana
    Champaign)
  * Approximating Outside the Processor.  
    Phillip Stanley-Marbell and Martin Rinard (MIT)
  * Approximating with Input Level Granularity.  
    Parker Hill, Michael Laurenzano, Mehrzad Samadi, Scott Mahlke, Jason Mars,
    and Lingjia Tang (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)

**3:00--3:30pm:** Break

**3:30pm--4:30pm:** Position paper talks, session 3: *Efficiency*

10+3 minutes per talk; 10 minutes small-group discussion; 10 minutes large-group discussion.

  * Colony of NPUs: Scaling the Efficiency of Neural Accelerators.  
    Babak Zamirai, Daya Shanker Khudia, Mehrzad Samadi, and Scott Mahlke
    (University of Michigan)
  * Texture Cache Approximation on GPUs.  
    Mark Sutherland, Joshua San Miguel, and Natalie Enright Jerger (University
    of Toronto)
  * Approximate Program Synthesis.  
    James Bornholt, Emina Torlak, Luis Ceze, and Dan Grossman (University of
    Washington)

**4:30--5:00pm:** Closing discussion: The future of approximate computing
