## Workshop Program

Position paper talks have 10-minute slots. Each has 10 minutes for discussion: 5 minutes for discussion within tables, and 5 minutes for whole-group discussion with questions for the speaker. Each session has 3 papers, where (10 minutes + 10 minutes) * 3 = 1 hour.

### Saturday, June 13, 2015; OCC C120--C121

**9:00--10:00am:** Position paper talks: *Quality*

  * Towards Automated Differential Program Verification for Approximate
    Computing.

    of Utah)
  * ACOCO: Adaptive Coding for Approximate Computing on Faulty Memories.  
    Chu-Hsiang Huang, Yao Li, and Lara Dolecek (UCLA)
  * REACT: A Framework for Rapid Exploration of Approximate Computing
    Techniques.

    Sampson, Luis Ceze, and Mark Oskin (University of Washington)

**10:00--10:20am:** Break

**10:30--11:00am:** Lightning talks. Each speaker gets 90 seconds and 90
seconds for questions. The rest of the time is for discussion.
