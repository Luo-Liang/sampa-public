## Preliminary Program

This is the preliminary schedule for WAX. We may continue to make small changes, so please check back. In particular, lightning talks are still coming in---please [submit yours][lightning]! We will also link to the final versions of the position papers here after June 3. (If you're an author, please upload your final version to [the HotCRP instance][hotcrp].)

If you have any questions, please [email the organizers][organizers].

### Saturday, June 13, 2015; OCC C120--C121

**9:00--9:30am:** Opening and introductions

Be ready to say who you are, where you're affiliated with, and why you're at the workshop.

**9:30--10:30am:** Position paper talks, session 1: *Quality*

Each talk will be 10 minutes, and each will have 3 minutes for short clarification questions immediately afterward.

The last 20 minutes of the session will be for discussion of all three papers: first, we'll spend 10 minutes in small-group discussion; the last 10 minutes will be for discussion among the whole group and asking questions of the speakers.

  * Towards Automated Differential Program Verification for Approximate
    Computing.  
    Shuvendu K. Lahiri (Microsoft Research) and Zvonimir Rakamaric (University
    of Utah)
  * ACOCO: Adaptive Coding for Approximate Computing on Faulty Memories.  
    Chu-Hsiang Huang, Yao Li, and Lara Dolecek (UCLA)
  * REACT: A Framework for Rapid Exploration of Approximate Computing
    Techniques.  
    Mark Wyse, Andre Baixo, Thierry Moreau, Bill Zorn, James Bornholt, Adrian
    Sampson, Luis Ceze, and Mark Oskin (University of Washington)

**10:30--11:00am:** Break

**11:00--11:30am:** Lightning talks

Each speaker gets 60 seconds to present and 60 seconds for questions while the next speaker gets in position. Any time left over at the end will be for large-group discussion and more questions for the speakers.

**11:30am--noon:** Organizing for lunchtime discussions

We'll select topics for discussion over lunch, assign groups to topics, and choose a scribe for each group. The scribe will be responsible for reporting out from the discussion after lunch.

**noon--1:30pm:** Lunch

If you're a group's scribe, be sure to use the last few minutes of the lunch slot to prepare for reporting out---make your slides if you want to use any.

**1:30--2:00pm:** Summary discussion from lunch breakouts

Each group's scribe has a few minutes to talk and lead discussion on the results from the topic.

**2:00--3:00pm:** Position paper talks, session 2: *Domains*

10+3 minutes per talk; 10 minutes small-group discussion; 10 minutes large-group discussion.

  * Statistical Information Processing: Extending the Limits of Approximate
    Computing.  
    Sharad Malik and Naveen Verma (Princeton University), Subhasish Mitra
    (Stanford University), and Naresh Shanbhag (University of Illinois, Urbana
    Champaign)
  * Approximating Outside the Processor.  
    Phillip Stanley-Marbell and Martin Rinard (MIT)
  * Approximating with Input Level Granularity.  
    Parker Hill, Michael Laurenzano, Mehrzad Samadi, Scott Mahlke, Jason Mars,
    and Lingjia Tang (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)

**3:00--3:30pm:** Break

**3:30pm--4:30pm:** Position paper talks, session 3: *Efficiency*
