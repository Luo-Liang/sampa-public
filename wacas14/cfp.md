## Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the System Stack (WACAS) 2014
Co-located with [ASPLOS 2014](http://www.cs.utah.edu/asplos14/) &mdash; March
1, 2014 &mdash; Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

With transistor scaling becoming less effective at improving computer system
performance and energy efficiency, we urgently need options that provide a path
forward for the IT industry.  Trading off accuracy for better performance and
energy efficiency is an attractive option for many important and
resource-hungry applications, such as image and video processing, computer
vision, machine learning, simulations, etc. For that reason, approximate
computing is quickly becoming a “hot topic,” with active research in computer
architecture, programming languages, operating systems and user-facing areas
such as ubiquitous computing and HCI.

Making approximate computing successful requires cooperation among all layers
of the stack, from algorithms to programming languages to OSes to architecture
to circuits, as well as system components like storage and networks.  This
workshop aims to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to
present and discuss thoughts and ideas on how to effectively exploit
approximate computing.

The organizers are aiming for a mix of invited talks, debate, panels and
peer-reviewed papers. Peer-reviewed papers will not be published in a
proceedings, so submitting to WACAS will not preclude future publication
opportunities. Topics include but are not limited to the following:

* Hardware support for approximate computing
* Programming languages and compiler support for approximate computing
* Tools for writing, debugging, and testing approximate programs
* Modeling and understanding approximate computing opportunities and systems
* Applications amenable to approximation
* Reflections on past work on approximate computing
* Position papers on approximate computing, potential, how it would fail, what
  we need to succeed, etc.

Prospective authors of research papers should aim for 6 pages including
references. Position papers and short notes should aim for 2 pages.
