title: "DECAF: Probability Types"
---
Approximate computing needs programming systems that can bound the chance that a result will be wrong. DECAF (**D**ECAF, an **E**nergy-aware **C**ompiler to make **A**pproximation **F**lexible) is a language that uses *probability types* to control incorrectness.

### Paper
