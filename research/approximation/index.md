title: Approximate Computing
---

The power consumption of CPUs and memory systems has traditionally been constrained by the need for strict correctness guarantees: processor voltage, for instance, must allow enough slack as to prevent even the rarest timing errors. Many modern applications, however, do not require perfect correctness. An image renderer, for example, can tolerate occasional pixel errors without compromising overall quality of service. Approximate computing exploits these error-tolerant applications to run programs more efficiently.

[EnerJ](enerj.html) is a language. Then talk about truffle, NPU and new explorations on passert, wireless, hw prototyping etc. 

Maybe a picture from recent papers/proposals with the levels of the stack and what we did in each?
