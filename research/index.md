### Grappa

Something about [Grappa](grappa.html).

### Operating System Implications of Non-Volatile Main Memory Systems

A [link](nonvolatile.html) to that cool stuff.

### Architecture and System Support for Debugging and Failure Avoidance in Concurrent Programs

Research on [bug detection and avoidance](concurrencybugs.html) is just the greatest.

### Support for Explicit Runtime Concurrency Errors

Let's catch all the [concurrency errors](concurrencyerrors.html).

### Improving Power Efficiency of Web-Enabled Mobile Devices

It's a research project named [chuckle](mobileweb.html).

### Deterministic Multiprocessing (DMP)

[Determinism](dmp.html) is inevitable.

### Approximate Computing

Links to [EnerJ](approximation/enerj.html) and [NPU](approximation/npu.html) pages, and possibly a generic [approximation](approximation/) page.
