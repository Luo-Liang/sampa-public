Some introductory text here, perhaps, to introduce the themes.

### Concurrency

Something about [Grappa](grappa.html).

Research on [bug detection and avoidance](concurrencybugs.html).

Something about [concurrency errors](concurrencyerrors.html). There's also a separate [concurrency exceptions](concurrencyexceptions.html) page.

[Deterministic multiprocessing (DMP)](dmp.html) is one set of projects.

A link to [OSHA](osha.html).

### Approximate Computing

Links to [EnerJ](approximation/enerj.html) and [NPU](approximation/npu.html) pages, and possibly a generic [approximation](approximation/) page.

### Emerging Technologies

Including [system implications of nonvolatile memories](nonvolatile.html).

Perhaps link to [mobile web](mobileweb.html) and [WebChar](webchar.html)?
