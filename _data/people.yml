        Dan is an Associate Professor at UW-CSE. His research background is
        programming language design and implementation, particularly for
        improving software quality. In Sampa, he's mostly involved with the
        DMP and OSHA projects. To get Dan excited about a non-computer-science
        topic, try ice hockey (playing or watching), non-fiction books, live
        theatre, hiking, or his nephew.
