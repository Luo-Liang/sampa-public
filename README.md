Sampa group website
==============================

This site uses [Jekyll][] and [bibble][] to generate a static Sampa website
complete with publications and blog posts.

`make` compiles the bibliography and the website content to the `_site`
directory, which is the directory to deploy to the webserver.

If you use an alternative Python when building the bibliography, use `make
PYTHON=/path/to/python`.
